The Klimaanlage in the Ratskeller was broken again. 
Patrons in dirndel will find their visit more pleasant. 
Unfortunately the local hund ate the last apfelkuchen, and all that was left was a Bratwurst.
The Baeckerei was in an uproar for it was the greatest of their Gebaeck.
Frau Eltz showed up in her shiny new Porsche and said "There is plenty of Brot over at the biergarten."
I bought a new BMW, but really wish I had gone with the Porsche.
Frau had forgotten to wear their Lederhoses but was not to worried.
"You should wear your lederhosen, for their klimaanlage will remind you of winter!"
